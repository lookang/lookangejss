# Interactive Multiples Web Applications

This repository contains a series of interactive web applications, each designed to help users understand the concept of multiples for a specific number. Each folder, named `Interactive_Multiples_of_X` (where X ranges from 2 to 12), houses a self-contained web application focused on teaching the multiples of that particular number.

## Project Structure

Each `Interactive_Multiples_of_X` folder typically includes:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the interactive web application.
- `[Number] Times Magic.mp3` or similar: An audio file providing a song or sound effects related to the multiples.
- `Interactive_Multiples_of_X.zip`: A compressed archive of the application.
- `README.md`: A specific README file detailing the contents and features of that particular application.

## Purpose

The primary goal of these applications is to provide an engaging and interactive learning experience for students to grasp multiplication concepts, specifically focusing on multiples of numbers from 2 to 12.
